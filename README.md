# algos2

This mock project was used to test the following:

It was the first step when working with a POC Using conbench for [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) benchmarks.
I needed a small project to learn how to use [asv](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
I was able to add delays and detected them as performance regressions (with asv) locally.

The second time this little code was useful, was to create templates for [Narwhals](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/).
Those templates are used when new issues and pull requests are opened. I first made sure they worked on this project, 
then I contributed them to Narwhals. 

The last use was for testing a release drafter, also for Narwhals. I had to do many PRs here, with the only purpose
of testing the drafter.
