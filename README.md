# algos2

This project was useful to test the following:

It was the first step when working with a POC Using conbench for [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) benchmarks.
I needed a small project to learn how to use [asv](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
With this I added delays, and detected them as performance regressions (with asv) locally.

The second time this was useful, was to create templates for [Narwhals](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/).
The templates are used when issues and pull requests are opened. I first made sure they worked on this project, 
then I contributed them to Narwhals. 

Testing "release drafter" labels..
