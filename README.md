This project was useful to test the following:

It was the first step when working with a POC Using conbench for pandas benchmarks. I needed a small project to learn how to use asv. With this I added delays, and detected them as performance regressions (with asv) locally.

The second time this was useful, was to create templates for Narwhals. The templates are used when issues and pull requests are opened. I first made sure they worked on this project, then I contributed them to Narwhals.

Now testing "release drafter"
